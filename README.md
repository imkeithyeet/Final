## Welcome to  Us Dating App Project!

This is a full-stack project using React to build frontend and Ruby on Rails to build backend.

The backend code is in the root directory of this project, and the frontend code is in the client directory.

Fork and clone this repo, cd into the directory and run:

```console
bundle install
```
to install all the backend dependencies, then run:

```console
rails db:create db:migrate
rails s
```


to setup the database and start the server.
Next, open another terminal window and run:
```console
npm install --prefix client
npm start --prefix client
```

to install all the frontend dependencies and start the application.
